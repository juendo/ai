 For example consider a game where a coin is flipped but kept hidden
and the player is offered the choice between a payment of 0.9 or a payment of
1 if the player can correctly guess the face up side of the coin and 0 otherwise.
The payment of 0.9 is the best, since the player has has an expected reward of
0.5 when guessing the face up side of the coin. However if PIMC is applied to
this game, in each determinization it is known which way up the coin is and the
guess the coin option always has a reward of 1.

For example, if a player could have played a winning card
on their previous turn and is playing rationally, the player does not hold the
winning card otherwise the game would be over. However PIMC would include
determinizations in which that player held that card, which is in fact incompatible
with the assumption of rationality (which asserts that players do not choose
actions that offer strictly lower utility than other actions).

It can be concluded that in order to apply PIMC search with MCTS, it is
always necessary to find the correct balance of simulations and determinizations
since the best balance was different for both Dou Di Zhu and LOTR:C. More
determinizations allows for a more diverse sample of possible states, but allows
for less time to analyse each state given a fixed computational budget.

The nodes in an ISMCTS tree represent unique histories from the point of
view of the root player. This means that nodes are distinguished only by the
observation the root player makes of the actions which lead to the node, so that
some nodes may correspond to many different information sets in the game
which are indistinguishable to the root player (but appear distinct to another
player)

Second game to implement should have hidden information at its core - skull?
